# CSG File Format

[CSG-format.md](CSG-format.md) contains a detailed specification of CSG-core file format (version 0.3). CSG-core format is the strict subset of [OpenSCAD](https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/CSG-File-Format/) CSG file format.

CSG-core format can be distinguished from OpenSCAD format by using version tag:

    #csg-core 0.3

## Motivation

There is no commonly acknowledged CSG file format. We need simple and well defined CSG format to share work easily and advance in CSG processing and visualization algorithms.
